        <p>   The Nexus 7 Tablet was to be used in the Medical Operation Room,
          to have it display Neuro-Muscular Stimuli data from a medical
          device connected to the patient's body by muscular sensors.
        </p>

        <p>   This Nexus 7 Tablet came without any user interface, though an Android browser
          was present. My job was to build the HTML5 User interface, controlled
          by JavaScript and JQuery and styled with plain Cascading Style Sheets.

        <p>This Real time data display on data change was a pilot project
          carried out at Q.W.Page Associates Inc. in Aurora, Ontario. This is
          an accounting software company that required real time data change notification
          to update all the clients reading that data. It also required the change of
          technology from TCL/TK to TCL/ HTML5, JavaScript(Angular.js) and CSS.

        <p>This project required a knowledge base for the management of IT knowledge to
          be used as an internal knowledge source for a Bank. The Company I worked for,
          called Next Pathway Inc. Toronto, Ontario was sub-contracted by this Bank to
          build their software. The key point of this project was to be responsiv, cross browser
          compatible, and to display static pages to be served by a Microsoft Share point back-end.
          My job was to build the front-end with HTML5, JavaScript and CSS.
